In order to run the game, download as a zip file and unzip. Afterwards click on Run Gun.exe (It has a kirby icon). This game was a created for University of Maryland CMSC425 class. It was created on a three month timeline from brainstorming to delivery. The code for the unity project itself can be found here: https://github.com/bronh123/runGunCode

Run Gun is a first-person horde shooter with roguelike elements focusing on freedom of movement. It draws inspiration from games like Vampire Survivors, Risk of Rain 2, and Doom. The game takes part in a arena with the objective of surviving as long as possible.
Waves of enemies will spawn and try to reduce the player's health to zero. Difficultiy increases with time, but the player also gets stronger through upgrades. These upgrades do not carry over between runs and will reset once the players health hits 0.

Buildings used in the desert map and the river from the forest are taken from the Unity store. All other assets and map layout are created by me.

Player damage sound and picking up experience is from Minecraft. Desert level music is Risk of Rain 2. Forest level music is from Battle Brothers. The main menu music was created by a friend. Some UI elements such as the exp bar are from Fzero-GX.
